Sippy Cup
---------

Sippy Cup is a tool to generate [SIPp](http://sipp.sourceforge.net/) load test profiles. The goal is to take an input document that describes a load test in a very simple way (call this number, wait this many seconds, send this digit, wait a few more seconds, etc).  The ideas are taken from [LoadBot](https://github.com/mojolingo/ahn-loadbot), but the goal is for a more performant load generating tool with no dependency on Asterisk.
